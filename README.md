# Developer_Profile_Generator

User statement:

When I enter a GitHub username, a PDF document will be generated with information including the Developer's name, their location, a short bio, how many repositories they have, how many followers they have, how many people they are following and how many stars they have.

See the GIF file which demonstrates how to generate the PDF.
